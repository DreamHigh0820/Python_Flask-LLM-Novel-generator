# AING - AI Novel Generator
This is a web application that uses OpenAI's GPT-3 API to generate novel text based on user inputs. It allows users to input information such as the title, genre, main characters, and plot summary, and generates a short text prompt based on the provided inputs. The user can then generate multiple text outputs using the generated prompt, which can be used to help them write their own novel.

## Known Issues
The current build is slow and buggy.

# AING Developer Profit Pool Initiative
At AING, we believe in acknowledging and rewarding our developers for their dedication and hard work. To further incentivize and recognize the contributions of our development team, we have introduced the AING Developer Profit Pool Initiative.

## Overview
The AING Developer Profit Pool Initiative is designed to distribute 10% of the net profits (after breaking even) among the developers as a form of bonus or additional compensation. This initiative aims to foster a sense of ownership, pride, and motivation for developers to continue pushing the boundaries of AING's capabilities.

### Eligibility and Distribution
To be eligible for the profit pool, developers must have a commit on the AING GitHub repo, demonstrating their active contribution to the project. The profit pool will be disbursed on a predetermined schedule, such as quarterly or annually, to provide a consistent and transparent reward system. The pool will be distributed among all eligible developers, regardless of their roles or seniority.

### Implementation
* **Clear communication:** The purpose, eligibility criteria, and distribution schedule of the profit pool will be communicated clearly to team members to manage expectations and ensure transparency.

* **Fair distribution:** A fair system for distributing the profit pool among developers will be developed, considering factors like the number of commits, the complexity of tasks, or the level of responsibility.

* **Performance metrics:** Performance metrics will be established to track developers' contributions, both individually and as a team. This will help monitor progress, identify areas of improvement, and allocate the profit pool more effectively.

* **Legal and tax compliance:** The profit-sharing plan will be implemented in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, following consultations with legal and tax professionals.

* **Periodic evaluation:** The effectiveness of the profit-sharing plan will be evaluated regularly, with adjustments made as needed to maximize its positive impact on the team and the project.

* **Other Rules _(Please watch)_:** No Mavericks, No Martyrs: Sustainable, Collaborative Production - https://youtu.be/ZbRVE_y1m18 

We are excited to introduce the AING Developer Profit Pool Initiative and believe it will significantly boost team morale, motivation, and commitment to the project's success. Together, let's continue to innovate and drive AING to new heights!
